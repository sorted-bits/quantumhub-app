# SDK

To build your own device, you can use the SDK. This SDK defines a couple of interfaces that you need to implement.

## Installation

You can install the SDK via npm:
```bash
npm install quantumhub-sdk
```

## Interfaces

### Device
Your device needs to implement the [`Device`](/docs/development/sdk/device/) interface. This interface defines the basic structure of a device.
